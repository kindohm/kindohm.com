        <h1>Running Windows VSTs on Linux</h1>

        <p>This is a technical review of how I got Windows VSTs working in Linux Mint (and Ubuntu) with Carla.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>On Mac and Windows, I've always used live synthesizers. Specifically, I get a lot of use out
            of <a href="https://image-line.com">Image Line's</a> Harmor synthesizer in FL Studio. I knew that my
            Harmor license included a VST download, and I also knew that others have had success with getting
            VSTs working in Linux. I decided to give this a try, and I'm glad I did because it worked
            with much less effort than I was expecting. </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>This is the loose set of steps I took to get it all working.
            Your mileage may vary, etc.</p>

        <h3>Resources</h3>

        <p>First off I just want to list two resources that helped me the most:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Discussion about how to get Carla installed: <a
                    href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1035116/cannot-install-carla-on-ubuntu-18-04">https://askubuntu.com/questions/1035116/cannot-install-carla-on-ubuntu-18-04</a>
            </li>
            <li>Video about how to get VSTs running with Wine and Carla: <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiaWozQ69eE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiaWozQ69eE</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Those links don't have everything I needed, which is why this post exists!</p>

        <h3>Install Carla</h3>

        <p>Carla is the thing that hosts your VSTs. It is available from kx.studio
            but you have to use their repositories to get it - or at least that's how I got it. </p>

        <p>You can enable their repository with the following commands
            (taken from <a href="https://kx.studio/Repositories">https://kx.studio/Repositories</a>):</p>

        <pre><code># Install required dependencies if needed
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https gpgv

# Remove legacy repos
sudo dpkg --purge kxstudio-repos-gcc5

# Download package file
wget https://launchpad.net/~kxstudio-debian/+archive/kxstudio/+files/kxstudio-repos_10.0.3_all.deb

# Install it
sudo dpkg -i kxstudio-repos_10.0.3_all.deb
</code></pre>

        <p>Then update your system and install Carla:</p>

        <pre><code># do not forget this!
sudo apt update

sudo apt install carla-git
</code></pre>

        <h3>Install Carla VST Bridges</h3>

        <p>Carla will scan your system for plugins, but in order for it to find
            VSTs you need to install a couple of apps:</p>

        <pre><code>sudo apt install carla-bridge-win32 carla-bridge-win64
</code></pre>

        <h3>Configure Carla's Experimental Features</h3>

        <p>The bridges will not work unless you enable Carla's "Experimental Features".
            Start Carla, then go into its configuration screen and choose to
            enable the experimental features. You'll get a new "Experimental" tab where you need
            to check the "Enable Plugin Bridges" and "Enable Wine Bridges" checkboxes:</p>

        <p>
            <img src="carla-experimental.png" alt="carla experimental settings" />
        </p>

        <h3>Install Wine and VST .exe</h3>

        <p>This step might be optional if you already have a .vst file. In my case, my
            VST is installed from a Windows .exe, so I needed to install Wine:</p>

        <pre><code>sudo apt install wine64

# also had to install wine32-development
sudo apt install wine32-development
</code></pre>

        <p>After downloading the Harmor installer, install it with Wine:</p>

        <pre><code>wine64 harmor_install.exe
</code></pre>

        <p>A Windows GUI will pop up for your installer. You can install it however you want, but just clicking
            "Next" through everything should be fine. <em>Just take note of where your VST's .dll files
                are being copied to.</em> There will be a lot of errors in the console, but you can ignore them.</p>

        <p>Finally, Carla will look for VST's in your `~/.vst` folder, so you might want to copy the newly
            installed VST to that location. Create `~/.vst` if it doesn't exist, locate your VST .dll in your
            Wine path, which is located under `~/.wine`, and then copy the .dll to `~/.vst`. You can also
            optionally tell Carla to look for other plugin paths.</p>

        <h3>Optional Stuff</h3>

        <p>My VST rendered itself without any text in its menus or GUI because I didn't have any
            fonts installed in Wine. I installed the fonts using `winetricks`:</p>

        <pre><code>sudo apt install winetricks
</code></pre>

        <p>Then run it:</p>

        <pre><code>winetricks
</code></pre>

        <p>This launches the Winetricks GUI, which is extremely awkward. Navigate through it until you find
            the option to install a font, and choose the `corefonts` font. When you execute this, Winetricks
            will pop up a ton of what look like modal error messages, but this is OK - just click OK on each
            of them, and all the fonts will be installed.</p>


        <h3>Adding your VST to Carla</h3>

        <p>At this point you can finally scan for the VST in Carla and add it to the Carla rack.</p>

        <p>Run Carla, then choose Add Plugin, then click the Refresh button. You'll now see a new window
            that looks like this:</p>

        <p><img src="carla-refresh.png" alt="Carla Refresh Plugins" /></p>

        <p>Make sure that those "Windows 32bit" and "Windows 64bit" checkboxes are checked, then
            click "Scan". It should find your VST.</p>

        <p>On the Add Plugin screen, make sure that the "Bridged (Wine)" checkbox is checked under the
            Architecture section. Then you can search for your plugin name at the top:</p>

        <p><img src="carla-add-plugin.png" alt="carla add plugin" /></p>

        <p>Now your VST should be added. Click the gear icon in the rack to bring up your VST's GUI:</p>

        <p><img src="carla-added-vst.png" alt="added vst" /></p>
