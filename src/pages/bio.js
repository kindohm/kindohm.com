    <p>I am a sound artist and programmer living in Chaska, MN, USA.</p>
    <p>
      In my musical practice, I exploit untraditional logic and rules in
      rhythmic sequencing. I compose and perform electronic music using
      live-written computer code, drum machines, and synthesizers. In 2014 I was
      awarded the Minnesota Emerging Composer Award from the American Composer
      Forum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work as an independent software developer, focusing on full stack
      web-based projects involving front-end web browser frameworks and back end
      technologies such as node.js and .NET Core. With over 20 years of hands-on
      experience I enjoy building pretty much anything.
